      Million Dollar Foot Massage&trade; uses deeply healing essential oils and lotions, a sea salt 
      scrub and hot towels, and will leave you feeling relaxed yet invigorated, sending you into a 
      heavenly state of relaxation - like a million dollars - rested, refreshed and rejuvenated!
      </p>
      <p>
      Best of all:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It won't mess up your hair</li>
        <li>You won't have to get undressed</li>
        <li>It can reduce pain in feet and lower legs</li>
        <li>It improves circulation and promotes relaxation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Let your body, mind and spirit unwind as Mary pampers your feet in a rhythmic,
      choreographed fashion incorporating stretches and massage techniques, leaving your feet 
      (and you!) feeling like a million dollars.
      </p>

          <h4>Meet Mary</h4>
		  <p>I am a massage therapist with a Diploma in Therapeutic Massage, an APNT Massage and pregnancy diploma and I am a member of Massage New Zealand.  I have been practicing massage since 2005.</p>
		  <p>I enjoy incorporating foot massage into my full body massage treatments as I believe that we don't appreciate our feet enough, hardly even noticing them until something goes wrong and they begin to hurt. When that happens the entire body is affected and you can feel tired and miserable.  I believe that relaxed feet can influence how (remove great) your whole body feels.</p>
		  <p>I was excited to discover Million Dollar Foot Massage, a wonderful way to treat the feet and relax the whole body. With up to 60 minutes spent treating the feet and lower legs but benefitting the entire person, it really is a full body experience.</p>
		  <p>I am proud to be a director of Hukanui Body Therapies Ltd - a team of dedicated professional natural health therapists, working together to provide you with the best possible personal care.</p>
